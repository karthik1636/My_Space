          <p>
            In earlyÂ 2024 I volunteered with the American Red Cross to streamline an
            important but timeâ€‘consuming task: analysing receipts from hundreds of
            monthly donations and expenditures. Disaster response teams relied on
            manual review, which meant long hours and potential delays in
            reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tackle this challenge I built a generative AI agent using Azure
            PromptFlow. The system ingests PDF and image receipts, extracts
            structured data and uses a large language model to categorise and
            summarise spending. Key metrics are then loaded into a dashboard to
            provide an atâ€‘aâ€‘glance overview of funds deployed across different
            disaster response activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            By automating receipt analysis we reduced manual effort by more than
            85% and saved roughly 10 hours per week. The faster turnaround
            enabled teams to make quick decisions and ensure resources were
            allocated where they were needed most. This project reinforced my
            belief that modern AI tools, when paired with thoughtful design,
            can have a real impact on humanitarian efforts.
