            Integrating data across multiple electronic health record (EHR)
            systems is a complex undertaking. At UnitedHealth Group I worked on
            merging information from EPIC, Cerner and Meditech into a single
            warehouse built on Google BigQuery. The goal was to reduce data
            retrieval time and provide clinicians with a holistic view of
            patient care.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used Talend and ApacheÂ NiFi to orchestrate extraction,
            transformation and loading of millions of records each day. FHIR and
            HL7 standards were applied to ensure interoperability and data
            quality. Once unified, the data fed into interactive Tableau
            dashboards displaying patient flow, resource allocation and clinical
            outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building this system taught me that technical proficiency alone
            isn't enoughâ€”clear communication with stakeholders is crucial. By
            engaging clinicians, IT teams and compliance officers throughout the
            process, we created a solution that met regulatory requirements and
            delivered realâ€‘time insights. The project ultimately improved
            operational efficiency byÂ 20% and opened the door to more advanced
            predictive modelling in the future.
